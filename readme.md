# ThunderPHP - A Plugin-Based PHP Framework

ThunderPHP is a PHP MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework designed to accelerate your web development projects by harnessing the power of plugins. Unlike starting from scratch with every project, ThunderPHP allows you to build upon a solid foundation, combining the flexibility of WordPress with the simplicity of lightweight frameworks like CodeIgniter.

## Features

- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: ThunderPHP adopts a plugin-centric approach, making it easy to extend and customize your web applications. Choose from a variety of plugins to add functionality and features as needed.

- **MVC Structure**: ThunderPHP follows the Model-View-Controller pattern, promoting a structured and organized codebase that separates concerns, enhances maintainability, and streamlines development.

- **Rapid Project Start**: With ThunderPHP, you can kickstart new projects faster, thanks to its pre-built plugins and framework capabilities. Spend less time on boilerplate code and more on creating unique and innovative web applications.

## Important Notice
Some of the core functionality may not work if you download the code branch-wise. To avoid issues, I recommend downloading the **main code file** with all the updated and required plugins. This will ensure that we are on the same page and avoid potential problems.

Branches in ThunderPHP are primarily used for development, flexibility, and readability. They exist to streamline the development process for me. However, the code is designed in such a way that it will run even if you delete a branch. In short, branches are for development ease, and the **main branch** should be your go-to for the complete, functioning framework.
